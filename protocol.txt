Peer API
-----------------
Function definitions:
  sign() is an RSA signature
  hash() is a Skein-512-512 hash

To store a key, value pair:

PUT or POST the following form fields to baseurl/data/key:
  value is the value you want to associate with the key
  signature is sign(privkey, value)
  privkey is the client's RSA private key

To get a value for a key:

GET baseurl/data/key returns:
{'value': value, 'signature': signature}

where
  value is the value associated with the key
  signature is sign(privkey, value)
  privkey is the server's private RSA key

To add self to the network:

GET baseurl/challenge returns a JSON string
PUT or POST to baseurl/addPeer the following form fields:
  challenge is the value returned from baseurl/challenge
  response is sign(privkey, challenge)
  privkey is client's private RSA key
  callback is client's own baseurl

Client's closest peers will respond be calling challenge and addPeer on client callback URL
